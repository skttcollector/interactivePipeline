GENERIC:
    check out game exporter stuff re: 2017, 2018
    documentation
    asset info - have some string to delineate what folders/files to skip over ("~", "_") when parsing for assets/names, etc

PIPELINE:
    more generic way to get/set env variables - mostly there already. . . 
    do fileManager (where it gets buttons, procedural buttons), if there is something in the variables, then don't need the change project window?
    call set project in the user setup properly    

ASSET MANAGER - 
    import option
	- variant referencing
	- replace ref option? this should convert namespaces. . . 
	- fix intitializing issues on load
    tool for referencing anim publishes

FILE MANAGER:  
    - if file has been published, make it italics
    - images for assets?

PUBLISH:
    re-adjust naming convention on anim publishes (line up Asset with stage MBs)
    figure out how to make the automate-able - message to slack
    some kind of database of assets?
	Notes for shots on publish (or even version up)
	give option to rename the fbx publish (checkboxes for each token)
	all should publish to folders?
	send an email or slack notice
    on model export, clean up a bit, pivot to origin, freeze transforms, etc
    make a tool for exporting indiv clips from anim file
    Asset anim - maybe this hsould be selection based also? what to do with imported stuff
